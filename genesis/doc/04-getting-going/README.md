# Getting going

This section builds on _Getting started_ and explores basic concepts such as:

* [**`var t T`**](./01-var-t.md): declaring a new instance of `T` with `var`
* [**`new(T)`**](./02-new-t.md): declaring a new instance of `T` with `new`
* [**Structs**](./03-structs.md): structs and generics
* [**Structural constraints**](./04-structural-constraints.md): expressing constraints with structs
* [**Interface constraints**](./05-interface-constraints.md): composite constraints that include interfaces
* [**Careful constructors**](./06-careful-constructors.md): when struct vs. interface constraint really matters
