# Runtime type safety

With a firm grap of _type erasure_ it is time to explore which of the three languages offer _runtime type safety_. For example, if a generic list is instantiated at compile time as a list of integers, can a string be added to the list at runtime? Let's take a look!

* [**Java**](./01-java.md): will its type erasure prevent Java from having runtime type safety?
* [**.NET**](./02-dotnet.md): how safe _is_ .NET's common language runtime (CLR)?
* [**Golang**](./03-golang.md): and finally, what about Go?
