# Runtime instantiation

So far .NET and Go are neck and neck, but will this continue? This section covers _runtime instantiation_ -- the ability to instantiate new types using generics at runtime. Think of a generic like a _template_ -- no, not the C++ [kind](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/extensions/generics-and-templates-visual-cpp?view=msvc-170) of template; more like a cookie cutter. Can we still stamp out new cookies at runtime using Java, .NET, and Go?

* [**Java**](./01-java.md): can a new `ArrayList<T>` be instantiated at runtime?
* [**.NET**](./02-dotnet.md): or in the case of .NET, a `List<T>`?
* [**Golang**](./03-golang.md): and does `List<T>` even exist at runtime in Go?
